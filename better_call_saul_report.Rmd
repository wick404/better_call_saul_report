## Data:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
viewership_data <- data.frame(
  Season = rep(1:6, times = c(10,10,10,10,10,13)),
  Episode = c(1:10, 1:10, 1:10, 1:10, 1:10, 1:13),
  Viewers = c(
    6.88, 3.42, 3.23, 2.87, 2.71, 2.57, 2.67, 2.87, 2.38, 2.53,
    2.57, 2.23, 2.20, 2.20, 1.99, 2.11, 2.03, 1.93, 2.06, 2.26,
    1.81, 1.46, 1.52, 1.56, 1.76, 1.72, 1.65, 1.63, 1.47, 1.85,
    1.77, 1.55, 1.51, 1.53, 1.53, 1.40, 1.35, 1.37, 1.35, 1.53,
    1.60, 1.06, 1.18, 1.22, 1.45, 1.40, 1.30, 1.42, 1.51, 1.59,
    1.42, 1.16, 1.16, 1.16, 1.22, 1.13, 1.19, 1.16, 1.22, 1.20, 1.34, 1.32, 1.80
  )
)
```


## Summary of viewership:
```{r summary}
viewership_summary <- viewership_data %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(
    Min = min(Viewers),
    Max = max(Viewers),
    Mean = mean(Viewers),
    Median = median(Viewers),
    Episodes = n()
  )

viewership_summary

```

## Viewership over time 1:
```{r viewership over time}
ggplot(viewership_data, aes(x = Episode, y = Viewers, group = Season, color = factor(Season))) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Viewership Over Episodes by Season",
    x = "Episode Number",
    y = "Viewers (in millions)",
    color = "Season"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

## Viewership overtime 2:
```{r viewership over time}
viewership_data <- viewership_data %>%
  mutate(Episode_Sequential = row_number(),
         Season = as.factor(Season))  #


ggplot(viewership_data, aes(x = Episode_Sequential, y = Viewers, fill = Season)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    title = "Better Call Saul Viewership by Episode (Sequential)",
    x = "Episode Number (All Seasons)",
    y = "Viewers (in millions)",
    fill = "Season"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)



```

## Change in viewership between first and last episode of the season:
```{r change in viewership:}
premiere_finale_diff <- viewership_data %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  summarise(
    Premiere = first(Viewers),
    Finale = last(Viewers),
    Diff = Finale - Premiere
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Diff_label = ifelse(Diff > 0, paste0("+", round(Diff, 2)), round(Diff, 2)),
    Season = factor(Season)
  )

ggplot(premiere_finale_diff, aes(x = Season, y = Diff, fill = Diff > 0)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE, width = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "forestgreen", "FALSE" = "tomato")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Diff_label), vjust = ifelse(premiere_finale_diff$Diff > 0, -0.5, 1.5), size = 5) +
  labs(
    title = "Change in Viewership from Premiere to Finale per Season",
    subtitle = "Positive values indicate growth in viewers; negative values indicate decline",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Viewership Change (millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic", color = "gray40")
  ) +
  ylim(min(premiere_finale_diff$Diff) * 1.2, max(premiere_finale_diff$Diff) * 1.2)

```
## Key Observations

- The pilot episode had the highest viewership at **6.88 million**, reflecting strong interest due to the *Breaking Bad* connection.
- Viewership steadily declined across seasons, with Season 6 averaging only about **1.27 million** viewers.
- A notable drop occurred between Season 1 and Season 2, with the average viewership falling from **3.15** to **2.16 million**.
- Within seasons, most fluctuations are under **±0.5 million**, except in Season 1 where Episode 2 dropped by **3.46 million** from the premiere.
